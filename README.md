When you click on **Play**, the battlecruiser will start in the bottom of the screen, and the asteroids will fall from the top with differents velocities.

The most important goal is getting the highest score. Your name will be put in the Top 10 if get a good score. Now, try to consider:
- There 5 kinds of asteroids.
- If you destroy the fastest kind of asteroid, you will get +25 points for your score.
- If you destroy the slowest kind of asteroid, you will get +5 points for your score.
